## Problem statment

Gasoline prices are on the rise
2. There is social awarness about eco friendly cars
3. Due to such reasons, the car industry is very conscious about fuel efficiency
4. This product will help the car industry to analyze historical data to determine what aspects of the car needs to be improved to get higher fuel efficiency

## Car fuel Efficiency

1. There are many factors (predictors) in a car that contribute to fuel efficiency
2. Picking the right factors (predictors) will result in accurate results
3. This product allows user to try multiple factors to determine the top three predictors

--- .class #id 

## Assumptions

1. It assumes all factors are independent and identically distributed
2. It assumes a maximum of three factors influence the fuel efficiency
2. It assumes the data provided in mtcars library is accurate and recent

## Overview

1. It uses Linear regression model with mpg (miles per gallon) as the dependent variable
2. It calculates linear regression of mpg agains the three chosen factors
3. It uses anova function to determine if these three factors influence mpg
3. Once the user finishes selecting three factors he/she must press submit to see the anova results
